<h2 id="service-level-indicator-sli-service-level-objective-slo-service-level-agreement-sla">Service Level Indicator (SLI), Service Level Objective (SLO), Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h2>
<h1 id="definitions">Definitions</h1>
<h1 id="service-level-indicator-sli">Service Level Indicator (SLI)</h1>
<p>A specific metric that quantifies the performance or reliability of a service. It’s a measurable attribute of the service that reflects how well it is performing from the user’s perspective. 
Common SLIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Latency</li>
  <li>Throughput (The number of requests served per unit of time, TPS)</li>
  <li>Error Rate (Percentage of requests returning errors)</li>
  <li>Availability (The proprotion of time the service is up and running this is usually the ratio of time the service is operational and able to serve requests)</li>
  <li>Saturation (A measure of how full the system is, such as CPU or memory utilization)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="service-level-objective-slo">Service Level Objective (SLO)</h1>
<p>A target or goal for the perofmrance of a serivce, as measured by an SLI. It’s essentially a promise you make internally about how reliable or performant a service should be.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To set SLOs, you should choose relevant SLIs that matter to your users and reflect their experience with your service.</li>
  <li>Set specific measurable targets for each SLI. For example, you might set an SLO that 99.9% of requests should be served within 500ms.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="error-budgets">Error budgets</h2>
<p>The difference between 100% availability and your SLO is your error budget. For example, if your SLO is 99.9% availability, your error budget is 0.1% downtime. This budget can be “spent” on planned maintenance, experiments, or other operational issues.</p>

<p>Note: Some companies Prometheus AlertManager integrated with Pagerduty to notify when SLO budgets are exceeded. An alerting rule can be created in Prometheus to trigger when an SLO is breached.</p>

<h2 id="burn-rate">Burn Rate</h2>
<p>The rate at which your service is consuming your error budget. Short-term burn rate detects rapid spikes that could quickly deplete the error budget. Long-term burn rates detect slower, sustained issues that could deplete the error budget over time.</p>

<p>(short_term_burn_rate = rate(http_requests_total{status!~”2..”}[5m])) / 0.001
(long_term_burn_rate = rate(http_requests_total{status!~”2..”}[1h])) / 0.001</p>

<h1 id="service-level-agreements-slas">Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</h1>
<p>An SLA is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the level of service expected. SLAs are typically legally binding and may include penalities if the service does not meet the agreed-upon SLOs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SLOs are included in the SLA, but with legal backing. They define the expected level of service, such as 99.9% uptime.</li>
  <li>SLAs can include penalties for not meeting SLOs, such as financial compensation or service credits.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="uses">Uses</h1>
<ul>
  <li>SLOs help guide operational priorities, focus engineering efforts, and set realistic expectations for service performance.
    <ul>
      <li>Note: Planned maintenances or necessary changes that cause impact should be factored into the error budget accounted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SLIs are the raw metric that measure your service’s performance. SLOs set targets for those metrics, guiding internal expectations and operation work. SLAs take those SLOs and put them into a formal agreement with customers, often including penalties if targets are missed.</li>
</ul>
