# Four Golden Signals

# Latency
 - The time it takes to service a request.

# Traffic
 - The demand on your system, often measured in requests per second or transactions per second.

# Errors
 - The rate of requests that fail, either by returning an error or failing to complete.

# Saturation
 - How "full" your service is, often measured by metrics like CPU or memory usage.
